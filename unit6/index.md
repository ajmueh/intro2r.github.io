# Programming in R

In this unit, you will learn how to create functions and learn some programming tricks.

Follow the links to each lecture, lab, and reading.

## Lesson 1. How to write less code

Lecture: [Writing your own functions](../unit6/functions.html)

Learning Goals:
 - Understand principles of programming,
 - Understand the elements of a function,
 - Style guide for function code,
 - Write simple functions,
 - Nest functions within other functions.

SWIRL: [Writing functions](../unit6/swirl/Functions.html)

Lab: [Unit 6: Lab 1](../unit6/labs.html)

Reading: [Best practice for writing R code](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/06-best-practices-R/index.html)

Functions: `function()`



## Lesson 2. How to automate your work

Lecture: [Control Structures](../unit6/control-structures.html) [slides](../unit6/control-structures-slides.html)

Learning Goals:
 - Use loops and ifelse statements,
 - Identify situations where loops are useful


SWIRL: [Loops](../unit6/swirl/Loops.html)

Lab: [Unit 6: Lab 2](../unit6/labs.html)

Reading: Crawley, M. *The R Book* Ch 2. Essentials of the R Language. 2.10 Loops and repeats

Functions: `if()`, `else()`, `for() {}`, `while() {}`, `repeat {}`, `break`, `next`


## Lesson 3: How to sample and generate random values

Lecture: [Sampling](../unit6/sampling.html).

Learning Goals:
 - Generate and use random numbers,
 - sample with and without replacement,


SWIRL: [Sampling and simulation](../unit6/swirl/Simulation.html)

Lab: [Unit 6: Lab 3](../unit6/labs.html)

Reading: Crawley, M. *The R Book* Ch 2. Essentials of the R Language. 2.9 Random numbers, shuffling, and sampling

Functions: `sample()`, `rbinom()`, `rnorm()`,
