# Sampling

Sampling is the process of selecting individuals/items/trees/things from a larger population. 

Often it is not possible to take data from each and every individual.

We use a sample to make inferences about the whole population.


## Every individual has the same chance of being selected

A [simple random sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_random_sample) is a subset of individuals/items/things chosen from a larger population.

Each individual is selected randomly, such that each individual has an equal probability of being selected.

Thus, any specific subset of individuals (a *sample*) has the same chance of being selected as any other.


## You can sample with or without replacement.

### Sampling withOUT replacement

Sampling **without** replacement means that once an individual has been selected, it is removed from the population and cannot be sampled again.

### Sampling with replacement

Sampling **with* replacement means that once the individual is selected, it is recorded as being selected, but it put back into the population. Thus, it may be selected again.


## Uses of sampling

There are several reasons to sample.

1. You may be selecting individuals, trees, items, etc. from which to take data. Using a random number generator, or sampling from the population ensures that your data are not biased in any way.

2. Sampling from a known probabiilty distribution (or simulating data from a known distribution) allows you to compare your data to this known distribution.

3. You can sample or simulate data to test your models.
