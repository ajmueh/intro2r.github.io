## Lab 1

1. Identify the type of data, check assumptions by plotting distribution of data, and choose and defend a statistical approach for the following

  a. Categorical data scenario (prop/chi sq test) e.g. alive vs dead trees
  
  b. Continuous data between groups e.g. measurement between sexes
  
  c. Continuous relationships e.g. simple linear regression
  
  d. Binomial response


2. Same, for survey data

  a. Categorical response
  b. Binomial response
  c. Count
  d. Continuous


3. For each data set, check for the 4 common problems with data i.e. non-normality, heterogeneity in variance, outliers, and zero-inflation.

  a. Data 1
  b. Data 2
  c. Data 3

## Lab 2

1. Binomial tests for flowering trees example

2. Chi sq tests
  a. Fish data
  b. Bird data

3. Use survey data to answer a question (it will be helpful to make use of the table() function here)
  a. Tea to coffee is it 50/50
  b. Your TA Andrew loves pineapple on his pizza – prior to this class, he was the only one we knew about. Using class responses, test whether Andrew is truly the only one who likes pineapple on his pizza.
  c. Do people with shoe sizes over 10 prefer pineapple?


## Lab 3


1. Michigan Tree Plot data. You may need to use google or the R help files…

2. New Haven road race data

3. Survey data

 - - -


## Lab 4

Use the sparrow data

1. Read in and evaluate data
  a. Check assumptions/for data abnormalities
  b. Make histograms

2. Answer the following questions
  a. Is there a skewed gender ratio, and make a plot to visualize
  b. Are there equal number of adults and juveniles, and make a plot to visualize

3. Answer the following questions
  a. Tarsus in females vs males, show with boxplot and barplot
  b. Head size in adults vs juveniles, show with boxplot and barplot
  c. Wing size by observer, post hoc tests to identify problem observers
  d. Anatomy measuring by both species and sex, is there an interaction and what is it telling you
  e. Compare means of the four combinations of variables

# How to submit your labs

## How to write up your lab answers

You will need to write R code to answer each of the questions.

Please format your answers as follows:

 - Copy and paste each question, commented out. This ensures that we know which answer corresponds to which question.

  - Write your R code answer below each question.

It should look something like this:

```
# LAB: Unit 1. Lab 1
# Your Name #  Put your name here

# 1. Add 7 and 3,456.
7 + 3456

# 2. Assign this value to an object
x <- 7 + 3456
```

## How to submit your lab answers on Canvas

 - Log into Canvas.

 - Go to the Assignments page.

 - Under ‘Labs’, you should find the correct assignment.

 - Copy and paste your R code into the text box.

 - Click ‘Submit Assignment’.

You are permitted to submit your answers as many times as you like within each Unit.

Answers will be graded two or three times a week and re-opened if you submit early.

Each lab will close at its respective deadline (see Canvas).

Final grades for each lab will be computed and entered into the Canvas gradebook at the end of each Unit.
