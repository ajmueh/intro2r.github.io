## Lab 1

Read in the housing value [data set](http://www.intro2r.info/data/) and answer the following questions. 

This lab will be a little more open ended – we are looking for key elements, but there is flexibility to correct responses.

Refer to the data page for variable names.

 

### 1. Plot the entire data set.

  a. Which variables appear correlated with housing value?

  b. Find the correlation coefficients between housing value and those variables identified in a.

 

### 2. Perform a simple linear regression with one predictor and housing value as your response variable (your y).

  a. Plot this relationship, and be sure to add your regression line to the plot.

  b. How well does your model fit? Plot the residuals against the fitted values, and identify any possible issues if they exist.

 
### 3. Perform a multiple regression with housing value as your response. You can include as many predictors as you think are important, including any interactions you think might exist.

  a. Ensure your predictors aren’t collinear.

  b. Interpret your model coefficients. What are each telling you?

  c. Between this model and your single regression model from Q2, which better fits the data? Test this statistically with `anova()`. Hint: You want a smaller residual sum of squares (RSS).

# How to submit your labs

## How to write up your lab answers

You will need to write R code to answer each of the questions.

Please format your answers as follows:

 - Copy and paste each question, commented out. This ensures that we know which answer corresponds to which question.

  - Write your R code answer below each question.

It should look something like this:

```
# LAB: Unit 1. Lab 1
# Your Name #  Put your name here

# 1. Add 7 and 3,456.
7 + 3456

# 2. Assign this value to an object
x <- 7 + 3456
```

## How to submit your lab answers on Canvas

 - Log into Canvas.

 - Go to the Assignments page.

 - Under ‘Labs’, you should find the correct assignment.

 - Copy and paste your R code into the text box.

 - Click ‘Submit Assignment’.

You are permitted to submit your answers as many times as you like within each Unit.

Answers will be graded two or three times a week and re-opened if you submit early.

Each lab will close at its respective deadline (see Canvas).

Final grades for each lab will be computed and entered into the Canvas gradebook at the end of each Unit.
