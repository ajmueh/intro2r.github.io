# Analyzing Continuous Data

In this unit, you will become familiar with running and plotting correlations and regression in R.

Follow the links to each lecture, lab, and reading.

## Lesson 1. How to test for correlation and causation

Lecture: Testing Associations -- [simple linear regression](../unit4/testing-associations.html)

Learning Goals:
 - Run correlation and simple regression models,
 - Interpret output,
 - Extract and plot details from output.

SWIRL: [Testing_Associations](../unit4/swirl/Testing_Associations.html)

Lab: [Unit 4: Lab 1](../unit4/labs.html)

Reading: Crawley, M. The R Book. Ch 10 Regression.

Functions: `ks.test()`, `cor()`, `lm()`, `abline()`, `coef()`.


## Lesson 2. How to work with multiple predictors

Lecture: [Multiple regression](../unit4/multiple-regression.html)

Learning Goals:
 - Understand how to code different statistical relationships,
 - Interpret model output and diagnose model fit

SWIRL: [Multiple_Regression](../unit4/swirl/Multiple_Regression.html)
