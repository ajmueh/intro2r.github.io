# Unit 2: Working with Data

In this unit you will learn more about matrices, dataframes,and lists, and how to import, export, and manage data. 

Follow the links to each lecture, lab, and reading.

## Lesson 1. How to work with dataframes and matrices

Lecture: Details of [dataframes and matrices](../unit2/matrices-and-dataframes.html).

Learning Goals:

 - Make and manipulate matrices,
 - Make and manipulate dataframes,
 - Examine the structure and contents, and extract elements of dataframes.

SWIRL: 

 - [Dataframes and matrices](../unit2/swirl/matrices_and_dataframes.html)
 
 - [Missing values](../unit2/swirl/missing_values.html)

Lab: [Unit 2: Lab 1](../unit2/labs.html)

Reading: [Missing Data](../best/missing-data.html)

Functions: `matrix()`, `data.frame()`, `rbind()`, `cbind()`, `head()`,`tail()`, `str()`, `is.foo()`, `nrow()`, `ncol()`, `dim()`, `rowSums()`, `colSums()`, `t()`.


## Lesson 2. How to extract subsets of data

Lecture: [Subsetting and indexing in R](../unit2/subsetting-and-indexing.html)

Learning Goals:
 - Extract dataframe columns with column names (`$`, `[, 'name']`),
 - Subset vectors with `[i]`,
 - Subset matrices, arrays, and dataframes with `[i, j]`,
 - Subset with logical operators (`>`, `<`, `!=`, `==`).

SWIRL: [Indexing and subsetting](../unit2/swirl/subsetting_dataframes.html)
