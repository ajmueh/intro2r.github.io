# Subsetting and Indexing

Subsetting in R is fast and incredibly powerful.

There are three subsetting operators: `[`, `[[`, `$`.

There are also important differences in how we subset different objects (vectors, lists, factors, matrices, and data frames).


### Subsetting and `str()`

Subsetting is a natural complement to `str()`. 

As you know, `str()` shows you the structure of any object, and subsetting allows you to 
pull out the pieces that youâ€™re interested in. 
This is particularly useful for plotting and presenting the results of statistical tests.


## Subsetting atomic vectors

We covered basic subsetting atomic vectors in Unit 1: [Subsetting Vectors](http://www.intro2r.info/unit1/swirl/subsetting_vectors) SWIRL lesson. 

We can subset atomic vectors in six ways.

Remember that each element has a index (position). We can use these indices to subset.

Take an example vector
```r
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

### i. Positive integer

Positive integers return elements at their locations.
```r
x[c(1,3,5)]
```
```
[1] 1 3 5
```

```r
x[c(1,1)]
```
```
[1] 1 1
```


### ii. Negative integers 

Negative integers return all elements *except* those locations specified.
```r
x[c(-1, -2)]
```
```
[1] 3 4 5
```

```r
x[-c(1, 2)]
```
```
[1] 3 4 5
```

**Note:** You cannot mix positive and negative indexes.
```r
x[c(-1, 2)]
```
```
Error in x[c(-1, 2)] : only 0's may be mixed with negative subscripts
```

### iii. Logical vectors
Logical statements test each element in your focal vector and returns a vector of TRUE or FALSE for each element.
Then, R selects the elements of your focal vector where the corresponding logical value is TRUE. 

First, make your logical statement.
```r
# x is equal to 2
x == 2
```
```
[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE
```

Embed the statement in brackets to select.
```r
# Subsect all elements equal to 2
x[x == 2]
```
```
[1] 2
```

All logical statements work: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.


### iv. Nothing

An index of nothing returns the entire vector. This is much more useful for matrices, arrays, and data frames (see below).
```r
x[]
```
```
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
```


### v. Zero
An index vector of 0 returns a vector of length 0, useful mostly for generating test data.
```r
x[0]
```
```
integer(0)
```

### vi. Character vectors
If the vector is named, we can index using these names.
```r
names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
x
```
```
a b c d e 
1 2 3 4 5 
```

```r
x['a']
```
```
a 
1
```

And you can repeat these indices, as with integers.
```r
x[c('a', 'a', 'c')]
```
```
a a c 
1 1 3 
```

## Subsetting matrices and arrays

```r
# Make a matrix
m <- matrix(1:4, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)
m
```
```
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    3
[2,]    2    4
```

You can subset matrices (2d) and arrays (>2d) higher-dimensional structures very simply with an extension of the method
used to index atomic vectors, by giving the 'coordinate' of each element, using brackets (`[`) as before, separated by commas.
E.g., for a 2d matrix: `[row, col]`.

```r
m[1, 1]
```
```
[1] 1
```

```r
m[ , c(1,2)]
```
```
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    3
[2,]    2    4
```

Blank subsetting is useful here because it allows you to keep all rows or all columns.
```r
# select row 1, all columns
m[1, ]
```
```
[1] 1 3
```

As with atomic vectors, we can use positive integers, negative integers, logical vectors, nothing, zero, and names to index.


## Subsetting data frames

```r
df <- data.frame(sample_id = c('i', 'ii', 'iii', 'iv'), x = c(1, 2, 3, 4), y = c(5, 6, 7, 8))
df
```
```
  sample_id x y
1         i 1 5
2        ii 2 6
3       iii 3 7
4        iv 4 8
```

We can use the 2d indexing for data frames as for matrices, to select specific elements: `[row, col]`.
```r
# select row 1, columns 1 and 2
df[1, c(1, 2)]
```
```
  sample_id x
1         i 1
```


### Accessing data frame columns

More usually, you will want to pull out specific columns, to plot or put into a model.

We can access columns by their position (remember that blank indexing extracts all rows/columns).

BEST PRACTICE: Is **not** to do this. Your column position may change. 
```r
# select columns 1, all rows
df[, 1]
```
```
[1] i   ii  iii iv 
Levels: i ii iii iv
```

It is therefore better to refer to columns by **name**, similar to with vectors and matrices.

```
# select cols x and y, all rows
df[, c('x', 'y')]
```
```
  x y
1 1 5
2 2 6
3 3 7
4 4 8
```

*Note:* If we refer to only one column by name in this fashion, we get a vector.
```r
df[, 'x']
```
```
[1] 1 2 3 4
```

We can also refer to column names using the 'list style' (dropping the comma). (*Note:* subsetting a single column like this maintains the data frame stucture).

```r
df['x']
```
```
  x
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
```

### Other operators: ` [ ` vs ` [[ ` and ` $ `

As we saw above, we can subset a dataframe and maintain the dataframe (i.e., list) structure.
```r
df['x']
```
```
  x
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
```

The use of `[[` and  `$` go 'one level down', pulling the components out and returning a vector from the data frame.
```r
df[['x']]
```
```
[1] 1 2 3 4
```
Notice that the column names are not retained here.
 

`$` is essentally short-hand for `[[`.
```r
df$x
```
```
[1] 1 2 3 4
```

Both these ways of subsetting are needed for plotting functions and others.



We can also subset dataframes by elements in particular columns, as for matrices.
```r
df[df$x > 2, ]
```
```
  sample_id x y
3       iii 3 7
4        iv 4 8
```

```r
df[df['x'] > 2, ]
```
```
  sample_id x y
3       iii 3 7
4        iv 4 8
```




## Subsetting Lists

Subsetting lists works similarly to vectors and dataframes.

```r
l <- list(a = 1:4, 
          b = c('i', 'i', 'ii', 'ii'), 
          c = c(1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4)
          )
l
```
```
$a
[1] 1 2 3 4

$b
[1] "i"  "i"  "ii" "ii"

$c
[1] 1.1 2.2 3.3 4.4
```


We can access each part by number,
```r
l[1]
```
```
$a
[1] 1 2 3 4
```

and by name.
```r
l['a']
```
```
$a
[1] 1 2 3 4
```


Using `[` returns a list structure (notice that the `$a` is retained in the output),

```r
l['a']
```
```
$a
[1] 1 2 3 4
```

whereas `[[` and `$` return the components of that part of the list.
```r
l[['a']]
```
```
[1] 1 2 3 4
```

```r
l$a
```
```
[1] 1 2 3 4
```

We can also index down into elements of the list.
```r
l$a[1:3]
```
```
[1] 1 2 3
```



## Subsetting and Assignment

All subsetting operators can be combined with assignment (`<-`) to modify selected values of the focal vector. 

```r
x
```
```
a b c d e 
1 2 3 4 5 
```


We can assign new values to specific indexed elements,
```r
x[2] <- 6
x
```
```
a b c d e 
1 6 3 4 5 
```

Use logical statements to revise several elements, 
```r
x[x > 3] <- 9
x
```
```
a b c d e 
1 9 3 9 9 
```

## Subsetting using subset()

So far we have used direct indexing to subset objects.

The function `subset()` is a wrapper that may be used to return subsets of vectors, matrices, lists, or data frames which meet logical conditions.

It has three main arguments.

 - `x` the object to be subsetted.
 
 - `subset` a logical expression indicating elements or rows to keep (NAs are taken as false and not kept).
 
 - `select` which columns to retain from a data frame (if you are using a data frame).
 
We can pull out specific rows. 
```r
# select a chosen sample id
subset(df, sample_id == 'i')
```
```
     sample_id x1 y2 z col4
row1         i  1  5 9    9
```

```r
# select data greater than 2, and select only two columns
subset(df, subset = x1 > 2, select = c('x1', 'z'))
```
```
     x1  z
row3  3 11
row4  4 12
```

## Using indexing to order objects, including data frames

We can use indexing to easily re-order data frames, using the function `order()`.

`order()` takes a vector as an input, and returns an integer vector that describes how the input vector should be ordered.
```r
# set a vector, a, with integers in the 'wrong' order
a <- c(2, 1, 4, 3)
# order() returns a vector with their 'correct' position 
# (i.e., the first element of a (2) should be in the second position)
order(a)
```
```
[1] 2 1 4 3
```

We can nest the call to `order()` within `[` to re-order a correctly. The output is now a ordered ascending numerically
```r
a[order(a)]
```
```
[1] 1 2 3 4
```

We can order descending, by changing the `decreasing = ` argument.
```r
a[order(a, decreasing = TRUE)]
```
```
[1] 4 3 2 1
```

We can use a similar principle to reorder data frames.
```r
# Here, we want to order based on df$z, from high to low
order(df$z, decreasing = TRUE)
```
```
[1] 4 3 2 1
```

Now we can nest this within indexing df. Remember that we still need to index by `[row, col]`.
```r
df[order(df$z, decreasing = TRUE), ]
```
```
     sample_id x1 y2  z col4
row4        iv  4  8 12   12
row3       iii  3  7 11   11
row2        ii  2  6 10   10
row1         i  1  5  9    9
```
