# Advanced Graphics and Programming

In this unit, you will learn how to add and modify basic plots, create functions and learn some programming tricks.

Follow the links to each lecture, lab, and reading.

Scroll down to download the SWIRL lessons.


## Lesson 1. How to add stuff to plots

Lectures: 

 - [Encoding values in points and lines](../unit5/encoding-values.html)

 - [Adding elements to plots and organising plots in space](../unit5/adding-to-plots.html)

Learning Goals:
 - Add elements to graphics (lines, text, symbols, labels, legends),
 - Using different graphics devices,
 - scaling figures

SWIRL: [Plotting More Data](../unit5/swirl/Plotting_More_Data.html)

Lab: [Unit 5: Lab 1](../unit5/labs.html)

Reading: [Bestiary of Graphics](../unit5/bestiary-graphics.html)

Functions: `abline()`, `text()`, `mtext()`, `points()`, `legend()`, `mfrow()`, `mfcol()`,


## Lesson 2. How to encoding values in graphics

Lecture: [Encoding values in color]()

Learning Goals:
 - Use plot elements (colour, size, shape, etc) to encode values,
 - Develop and use color palletes,


SWIRL:

Lab: [Unit 5: Lab 2](../unit5/labs.html)

Reading: [Exporting graphics](../unit5/exporting-graphics.md)

Functions: `palette()`, `pdf()`, `png()`


## Lesson 3. How to write less code

Lecture: Writing your own functions

Learning Goals:
 - Understand principles of programming,
 - Understand the elements of a function,
 - Style guide for function code,
 - Write simple functions,
 - Nest functions within other functions.

Lab: [Unit 5: Lab 4](../unit5/labs.html)

Reading:

Functions: `for() {}`, `if()`, `else()`,


## Lesson 5: How to sample and generate random values

Lecture: Sampling,

Learning Goals:
 - Generate and use random numbers,
 - sample with and without replacement,


SWIRL: Sampling and simulation

Lab: [Unit 5: Recap](../unit5/labs.html)

Reading:

Functions: `sample()`, `rbinom()`, `rnorm()`,
