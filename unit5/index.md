# Advanced Graphics and Programming

In this unit, you will learn how to add and modify basic plots, create functions and learn some programming tricks.

Follow the links to each lecture, lab, and reading.

Scroll down to download the SWIRL lessons.


## Lesson 1. How to add stuff to plots

Lecture: Adding elements to plots and organising plots in space

Learning Goals:
 - Add elements to graphics (lines, text, symbols, labels, legends),
 - Using different graphics devices,
- scaling figures

SWIRL:

Lab: [Unit 5: Lab 1](URL)

Reading:

Functions: `pdf()`, `png()`, `abline()`, `text()`, `mtext()`, `points()`, `legend()`, `mfrow()`, `mfcol()`,


## Lesson 2. How to encoding values in graphics

Lecture: Encoding values in points, lines, shapes, color, etc.

Learning Goals:
 - Use plot elements (colour, size, shape, etc) to encode values,
 - Develop and use color palletes,


SWIRL:

Lab: [Unit 5: Lab 2](URL)

Reading:

Functions: `palette()`


## Lesson 3. How to write less code

Lecture: Writing your own functions

Learning Goals:
 - Understand principles of programming,
 - Understand the elements of a function,
 - Style guide for function code,
 - Write simple functions,
 - Nest functions within other functions.
