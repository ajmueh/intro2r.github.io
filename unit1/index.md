# Unit 1: Getting StaRted

In this unit, you will become familiar with the R console, RStudio, and basic actions and operations in R.


## Lesson 1. What is R?

Lecture: Overview of R, demonstration of R.

Learning Goals:
 - Understand what R can and cannot do,
 - Install R and RStudio,
 - Know how to navigate within RStudio.

Lab: [Unit 1: Lab 1](../unit1/install-R-and-RStudio.html)

Reading: [NYT article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all)

Functions: None.


## Lesson 2. How to use R as a calculator

Lecture: Working with R and RStudio; How a computer works.

Learning Goals:
 - Perform operations on numbers and integers,
 - Assign numeric and character data to variables,
 - Manipulate variables with operators,
 - Understand and use paths and working directories.

SWIRL: Basic building blocks

Lab: [Unit 1: Lab 2](../unit1/labs.html)

Reading: skim Crawley Ch. 2?

Functions: `<-`, `getwd()`, `setwd()`.


## Lesson 3. How to work with vectors

Lecture: Types of data in R

Learning Goals:

 - Generate vectors using `c()`, `:`, `seq()`, `rep()`,
 - Assign these vectors to variables and manipulate them,
 - Identify types of vectors (numeric, integer, factor, character, ...)
 - Plot individual vectors with `plot()`.

SWIRL: sequences of numbers and vectors

Lab: [Unit 1: Lab 3](../unit1/labs.html)

Reading:

Functions: `c()`, `:`, `seq()`, `rep()`, `plot()`, `is.vector()`, etc


## Lesson 4. How to summarise vectors

Lecture: Data structures; Functions

Best Practice: Code style guide

Learning Goals:

 - Navigate to and from working directory with `getwd()` and `setwd()`,
 - Subset vectors with logical statements (`>`, `<`, `!=`, `==`),
 - Use functions to perform calculations, with `sum()`, `mean()`, `sd()`, etc.
 - Summarise the distribution of a vector with `boxplot()` and `hist()`.

SWIRL: Distributions and summarising data

Lab: [Unit 1: Recap](../unit1/labs.html)     Best Practice [lab](../unit1/labs.html)

Reading:

Functions: `getwd()`, `setwd()`, `sum()`, `mean()`, `sd()`, `summary()`, `length()`, `boxplot()`, `hist()`
